Quick write up of running jellyfin on a RPi-4 as well as some of the performance I observed. Ill add to this eventually, not sure if itll make it to the web if someone is looking for this. 
Also include the samba docker container stuff too because its cool and a fkin pain. oh and sorry for being lazy, but if someone actually finds this and actually needs help, contact me on discord, its in my bio, if I deny it, add me again and ill accept probably
